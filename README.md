# Import Ace
A simple program which will take all of the files in your project 
and make a file specifically containing all of their imports.


# How To Use 
1. Place the executable into your project
2. Run it
3. You now have all your files for your project inside of one file!


# The configuration file


```json
	{
		"output file": "import_wish.monkey2",
		"parse directory": "src",
		"ignore start": "_"
	}
```

- Output file : This is the file where your imports are dumped into
- parse directory : Directory where our project will start searching for monkey2 files
- ignore start: Will ignore any file which starts with the passed string
